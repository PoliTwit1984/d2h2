   - Optionally provides job title, company name, and industry for more targeted results

2. **Master Resume Entry**:

   - User clicks "Generate Citations" button
   - Backend scans the master resume for evidence of each keyword
   - For each keyword found, a citation is generated that demonstrates the user's experience
   - Citations are organized by priority level

2. **Review Citations**:
   - Citations are displayed in the citations panel
   - Each citation shows the keyword and supporting evidence from the resume
   - Keywords in the keyword list are marked with checkmarks (‚úì) if citations were found, or X marks (‚úó) if not
