# Updates for Industry Parameter Integration and JSON Parsing Fixes

## Completed Updates

### Frontend Updates

#### API Service Module (static/js/modules/api-service.js)
- [x] Fix duplicate industry parameter in extractKeywords function
- [x] Update generateCompetencies function signature to include industry parameter
- [x] Add industry parameter to form data in generateProfile function
- [x] Add industry parameter to form data in generateCompetencies function
- [x] Fix duplicate method: 'POST' line in generateCompetencies function

### Backend Updates

#### Route Handlers
- [x] Update the /generate route handler to process the industry parameter
- [x] Update the /generate-competencies route handler to process the industry parameter
- [x] Ensure all relevant backend services properly utilize the industry parameter

#### OpenAI Service
- [x] Fix JSON parsing error in OpenAI API response
  - [x] Added enhanced error handling to sanitize malformed JSON responses
  - [x] Added more detailed logging to capture the full API response for debugging
  - [x] Implemented a sanitize_json function to fix common JSON formatting issues
  - [x] Added fallback mechanisms for when JSON parsing fails
  - [x] Added specific handling for unterminated strings at the end of arrays
  - [x] Added handling for missing commas between objects in arrays
  - [x] Implemented a construct_minimal_json function to extract keywords from malformed JSON
- [x] Update prompt templates to incorporate industry context
- [x] Adjust temperature settings for citation finding (increased to 0.3)
- [x] Add debug logging for better troubleshooting

#### Keyword Service
- [x] Improved the extract_keywords function to try a simplified prompt before falling back to regex extraction
- [x] Enhanced error handling in the keyword extraction process
- [x] Fixed the highlighting of keywords in the job description

## Remaining Tasks

### UI Components
- [ ] Ensure the industry field value is properly passed to all API calls
- [ ] Update any form validation related to the industry field
- [ ] Update UI components to display industry-specific information if applicable

### Missing Keywords Logic
- [x] Fix missing keywords logic to ensure ALL keywords without citations are properly added to the missing list
- [x] Categorize missing keywords by priority (high/medium/low)
- [ ] Update templates/index.html to display missing keywords by priority

### Documentation
- [x] Create futurefeatures.md file to document the roadmap for v2
- [x] Update README.md with information about the new industry parameter
- [ ] Document the changes to the API endpoints

### Testing
- [x] Test keyword extraction with the industry parameter
- [ ] Test profile generation with the industry parameter
- [ ] Test competencies generation with the industry parameter
- [ ] Test edge cases (empty industry field, unusual industry names, etc.)

## Conclusion and Next Steps

The integration of the industry parameter is now complete, and the critical issues with JSON parsing in the OpenAI API response have been successfully addressed. The application can now properly extract keywords from job descriptions even when the OpenAI API returns malformed JSON responses.

The key improvements include:
1. Enhanced JSON sanitization to handle unterminated strings and incomplete JSON structures
2. A fallback mechanism that tries a simplified prompt before resorting to regex extraction
3. Better error handling throughout the application
4. Proper highlighting of keywords in the job description based on their priority

The next priorities are:
1. Complete the UI component updates to ensure the industry field value is properly displayed and validated
2. Update templates/index.html to display missing keywords by priority
3. Complete testing of all API endpoints with the industry parameter
4. Document the changes to the API endpoints

These remaining tasks will further enhance the user experience and improve the quality of the generated content.
